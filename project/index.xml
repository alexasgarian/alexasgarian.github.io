      <description>0. Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph. What are they measuring? How many observations?
My dataset is a compilation of two datasets from the server. The first, originally called &amp;quot;education&amp;quot;, was from the carData package (originally labeled &amp;quot;States&amp;quot;) and my second was called &amp;quot;partisan_lean_state&amp;quot; from the fivethirtyeight package. I also used stateabbr from the server to help combine the two packages on the basis of state.</description>
