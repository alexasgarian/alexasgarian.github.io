Pandas is a library of functions used to analyze data in Python. Personally, being more used to RStudio and the dyplr function, I use this table when confused using pandas. As you can see some overlap exists in the naming of the functions.

###So how do we get started? 

First we need to run "import pandas as pd".

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```


To display an example of a pandas function, I will be using the iris dataset.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
iris <- read_csv("iris.csv")
head(iris)
```



###Now, let's explore some basic functions!

```{python}
iris1 = r.iris
(iris1.filter(['sepal_width', 'sepal_length']).head(6))
```

Here we see filter acting as select would with dyplr. So pandas is choosing to look closer at values for sepal_width and sepal_length. To see the first six values for each variable, we use "head(6)". Note that instead of piping with "%", now "." acts as a pipe in Python.

We could further analyze this dataset by finding the mean sepal_length or sepal_width with the "agg" function. Or sorting the values of sepal_width and sepal_length in descending order to see which species has the largest sepal length and which has the largest sepal width.

"Filter" works to pull specific columns from the dataset while "query" pulls specific rows  for a specified variable. For example, all sepal lengths for the virginica species of irises can be pulled by specifying with "query" that you only want data from when "species=='virginica'". Then, "sort_values" can arrange the numerical rows of a variable in ascending or descending order. "Groupby" has the capability to clump categorical responses for a variable. For example, grouping by species of iris. "Assign" can add colums and data to your dataset while "agg" can perform mathematical calculations, such as, mean, median, and count.

Therefore, the pandas functions allow us to analyze and alter any dataset. As you can see, pandas works very similarly to dyplr to achieve similar results in Python instead of RStudio.
