Pandas is a library of functions used to analyze data in Python. Personally, being more used to RStudio and the dyplr function, I use this table when confused using pandas. As you can see some overlap exists in the naming of the functions.

###So how do we get started? 

First we need to run "import pandas as pd".

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

To display some of pandas functions, I will be using the quakes dataset.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
quakes <- quakes
head(quakes)
```



Now, let's just explore some basic functions!

```{python}
iris = r.iris 
(iris.filter(['Sepal.Width', 'Sepal.Length']).head(6))
```
