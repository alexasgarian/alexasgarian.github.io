I also used stateabbr from the server to help combine the two packages on the basis of state.</description>

      <description>0. Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph. What are they measuring? How many observations?
My dataset is a compilation of two datasets from the server. The first, originally called &amp;quot;education&amp;quot;, was from the carData package (originally labeled &amp;quot;States&amp;quot;) and my second was called &amp;quot;partisan_lean_state&amp;quot; from the fivethirtyeight package. I also used stateabbr from the server to help combine the two packages on the basis of state.</description>

      <description>Courtesy of: https://realpython.com/pandas-plot-python/  Pandas is a library of functions used to analyze data in Python. Personally, being more used to RStudio and the dyplr function, I use this table when confused using pandas. As you can see some overlap exists in the naming of the functions.
  So how do we get started? First we need to run &amp;quot;import pandas as pd&amp;quot;.
import pandas as pd To display an example of a pandas function, I will be using the iris dataset.</description>
